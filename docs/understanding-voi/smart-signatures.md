# Smart Signatures

Smart signatures are how logic is executed to sign transactions in a delegated way.

You are able to submit transactions with associated logic that will then sign the transaction if the logic is successfully evaluated. 

The smart signature must have been previously signed by the appropriate account to enable the delegation of signing to occur after the logic is resolved. 

This logic, like with smart contracts, is interpreted by the virtual machine that runs on nodes.
