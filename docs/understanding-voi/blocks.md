# Blocks

These are the tamper proof data structures that can contain 0 or more signed transactions that were submitted to the network after the previous block was produced.

Each block has a reference to the previous one which enables them to be chained together to form an immutable ledger.

Blocks are only written to the ledger after being certified via the consensus process by accounts staked on nodes which form the network.
