# State Proofs

State proofs on Voi blockchain are generated by the independent nodes running in the network, not by 3rd parties. 

The proof is subsequently exposed through a transaction which is also submitted by the nodes running in the network. 

This means that state proofs on Voi blockchain are done in a fully trustless and decentralized way.

State proofs can be used to independently verify whether a transaction has occurred or not within a given range of blocks in a completely trustless way.
