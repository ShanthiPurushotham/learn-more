# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are how logic is executed and state is recorded on-chain in a self contained and remotely callable way. They are created, destroyed and interacted with via transactions. 

They can be written in multiple languages on Voi blockchain, giving developers a choice of paradigms so that they can use the right tool for the job depending on what they want to create.

No matter what language is used to write the smart contract. It is ultimately compiled down to TEAL which is then interpreted by the virtual machine that runs on nodes.
