# Assets

Assets on Voi come in two different flavors. Each of which are powerful and can be leveraged in different ways to achieve the same outcome.

Both can be used to represent Fungible and Non-Fungible resources on the Voi blockchain as assets.

The main difference is that Standard Assets require a recipient to opt in to receive the asset first and they are not as extensible as Smart Assets.


### Smart Assets

Smart assets are represented by smart contracts and are created and interacted with by transactions that interact with smart contracts.


### Standard Assets

Standard assets exist without the need for smart contracts and are created and interacted with by transactions alone.
