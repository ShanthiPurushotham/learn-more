# Core Partner Getting Started Guide

Welcome, Core Partner! 

We’re thrilled to have you join our vibrant and dynamic community. As a Core Partner, you play a crucial role in tackling significant challenges and driving the strategic initiatives within the Voi ecosystem.

At Voi, our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all. We emphasize decentralization, democratic governance, and true ownership. Our vision is to empower the community through a token distribution model that reserves 75% of the ecosystem tokens for those who contribute to the network, ensuring that the community drives the network.

Core Partners are the strategic leaders and problem-solvers of our community. Your expertise and dedication help address key challenges, develop strategic initiatives, and ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the Voi ecosystem.

Typically Core partners may wish to create DAOs that collectively tackle problems faced by the ecosystem such as marketing, network health or other big picture issues.
