# Interacting With Voi Blockchain

Interacting with the Voi blockchain is always done through a node in the network. A node is a device with sufficient resources running the appropriate software that is connected to the network.

Every node on the Voi blockchain network runs Voi Algod,
software built into the node that allows users to interact with the network.
There are three main ways to interact with the network through a node.
There is the Command Line Interface (CLI), a series of APIs and SDKs implemented in a number of languages.

Developers should [run a local instance of a node](https://docs.voi.network/node-runners/run-a-participation-node/) so that they can interact with Voi blockchain.

There are also [public node APIs](https://docs.voi.network/developers/tools/) available that expose the API of a node run by a 3rd party.
