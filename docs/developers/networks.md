# Networks

Voi blockchain will have two public networks, mainnet and testnet. Right now, there only exists the testnet network.

### Mainnet

Genesis ID: `voimain-v1.0`

Genesis Hash: `r20fSQI8gWe/kFZziNonSPCXLwcQmH/nxROvnnueWOk=`

### Testnet

Genesis ID: `voitest-v1`

Genesis Hash: `IXnoWtviVVJW5LGivNFc0Dq14V3kqaXuK2u5OQrdVZo=`

### Devnet

It is also possible for developers to spin up their own local network for development purposes before deploying their applications to the Testnet environment and then subsequently the Mainnet environment.
