### API

There are multiple APIs exposed by nodes. These APIs allow for programmatic access to some of the daemons that run on the node.

All of the APIs follow the REST architectural style.

The APIs are as follows:

* [Algod](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/algod/)
* [Indexer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/indexer/)
* [Kmd](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/kmd/)
