# Tokenomics

Voi's economic design is engineered for long-term, sustainable ecosystem growth, with a full resource distribution plan
spanning 20 years.
This mitigates severe inflation, protecting users and stakeholders' interests.

To expedite scale within the first five years, Voi will distribute the ecosystem stake during this period. Subsequently,
the newly formed future foundations will gradually receive their 5% allocations over the following decade, amounting to
a total of 20%.

To swiftly bootstrap the network and ecosystem as well as later counteract inflation, early incentives are front-loaded
and entirely allocated within the first 18 months.

Block rewards, meanwhile, are to be fully allocated over the 20-year span. This ensures that node operators can sustain
themselves purely from block rewards and network security contributions until the network becomes self-sustaining on
fees alone.

Consequently, Voi ensures that 75% of network ownership directly benefits the community in various ways, demonstrating
our commitment to user-focused growth and long-term network stability.
