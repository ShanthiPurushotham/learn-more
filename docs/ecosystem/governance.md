# Governance

Voi's L1 blockchain governance model,
inspired by the tripartite system of many global governments, consists of three branches:

- Legislative (Voi Council)
- Executive (Voi Foundation)
- Judicial (Block Authority, Inc.)

Each branch has specific roles and responsibilities
to maintain a balance of power and prevent any single entity from dominating.

Voi’s governance model is built on the principle of checks and balances,
ensuring that no branch overpowers another and that the blockchain remains a balanced,
transparent, and fair system for all participants.

The setup ensures dedicated members of the Voi ecosystem directly can influence the future of the network and ecosystem.

## Legislative (Voi Council)

This branch, made up of community-elected members, reflects the community's voice, interest and priorities.
It is responsible for crafting and modifying governance rules, as well as proposing new initiatives.

## Executive (Voi Foundation)

This branch includes both elected and appointed community members.
It is responsible for the implementation of policies and decisions formulated by the Legislative branch,
aligning daily operations with the community’s values and objectives.

## Judicial (Block Authority, Inc)

Operated by the founders and appointed members, this branch provides guidance and ensures continuity.
It safeguards the constitution and the blockchain’s core principles,
acting as a guardian against unnecessary or capricious changes, ensuring amendments are justified and significant.
