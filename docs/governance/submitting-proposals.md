## **Overview of Application Process**

1. **Applicant Registration**
    * Any applicant requesting funding within the Voi ecoystem will be required to create an account on Voi's Grants Portal. This portal will provide a detailed overviews of available grants, eligibility criteria, and resources for applicants including a schedule for what can be expected in terms of the grants review timeline and process. This portal is anticipated to be completed in 2025. In the interim, a more manual and temporary process will be implemented involving Voi's Google Drive.
2. **Comprehensive Proposal Submission**
    * Applicants will be requested to select which of the previously described grants most appropriately fits their needs. They will then complete and submit a detailed proposal and pitch deck to the Voi Council for review. Applicants can seek support from Voi Coaches for guidance and proposal refinement. Information on the Voi Coaching Program can be found in the next section.
3. **Pitch Proposal to Council**
    * All development grants, Design or Build phase, require a formal pitch presentation to the Voi Council using the proposal pitch template provided. Applicants will be required to select a date to present their proposal to the Voi Council.
