# Overview

Welcome to the Voi Grants Program. The Voi Grants Program is central to the Voi ecosystem. The program aims to support and accelerate the development of innovative applications and projects within the Voi ecosystem. By providing funding, resources, and mentorship, the program empowers developers, marketers, and educators to create impactful solutions that align with Voi's mission and contributes to the growth and sustainability of the Voi community.

It is where promising open-source community-centric development and ecosystem services projects get funded. The significant allocation of Voi’s Treasury differentiates us from other networks, solidifying our commitment to ensuring a majority of Voi’s resources are used for efforts by our community to grow and develop the Voi ecosystem.
