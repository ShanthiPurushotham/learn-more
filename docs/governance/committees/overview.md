# Committees

Committees are critical in providing support for both Voi's ecosystem and council members. Committee involvement is a great way to have your voice heard within the ecosystem, influence governance decision-making, and assume community leadership without the immense time commitment involved in being a council member. Committees are a critical component of realizing Voi's mission of being a a community driven blockchain! 

Voi currently has 4 committees setup - the Builders committe, the Network committe, the DeFi committee, and the Culture & Community committee.
