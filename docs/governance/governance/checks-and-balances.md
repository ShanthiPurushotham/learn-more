# Checks & Balances 


We’ve introduced you to each pillar in Voi's tripartite governance system - the Council, the Treasury, and the Judiciary, each playing a crucial role in shaping our decentralized future. 

Here we share Voi's current Checks and Balances system—one we hope ensures fairness, accountability, and democratic integrity within Voi.

Our vision for Voi has always been rooted in the principles of transparency and collective empowerment. With our Checks and Balances system, we aim to create a governance structure where no single branch can dominate, ensuring that all decisions are made with the utmost consideration for the community’s best interests.


## **Checks and Balances Overview**

**Absolute Majority Vote:** Decisions within Voi’s governance system generally require more than half of the total membership, regardless of the number of members present and voting.

**Individual vs. Entities in Voting:** The Voi Council operates as a body of unique individuals for voting purposes. Meanwhile, the Voi Treasury and Judiciary vote as singular entities, based on their internal consensus mechanisms.

The full-fledged **[Checks & Balances document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExBb1I3X8ndL1lAtfDAzTMleAukEI43OtWrvflVP9Ak/edit)** has been summarized below:


**The Voi Council’s Powers:**

* **Approval/Denial of Proposals & Strategic Initiatives:** The Council reviews and approves significant operational changes or strategic initiatives proposed by the Treasury.
* **Budgetary Oversight:** The Council controls the blockchain's budget, ensuring fiscal responsibility and alignment with strategic goals.
* **Impeachment:** The Council can initiate proceedings to impeach and remove members of the Council or Treasury.
* **Veto Override Mechanism:** The Council can override vetoes from the Treasury and Judicial branches with unanimous votes.
* **Amendments to the Constitution:** Unanimous approval from both the Council and Treasury is required for amendments, ensuring full consensus.

**The Voi Treasury’s Powers:**

* **Veto Authority:** The Treasury can veto Council decisions if they compromise the blockchain's operational integrity or vision.
* **Impeachment Approval:** The Treasury must approve any impeachment initiated by the Council.
* **Amendment Approval:** The Treasury’s approval is necessary for any constitutional amendment.

**The Voi Judicial’s Powers:**

* **Veto Authority:** The Judiciary can veto Council decisions that violate the blockchain’s constitution or ethical guidelines.
* **Impeachment Rejection:** The Judiciary can reject the Treasury’s approval of an impeachment.
* **Interpretive Authority:** The Judiciary ensures that all actions comply with Voi’s governance rules and the Constitution.


We are optimistic about the potential of this Checks and Balances system to foster a fair and balanced governance structure for Voi.These mechanisms will be refined with feedback once the system is implemented and we will be able to make improvements in real-time, keeping the community abreast of any improvements.
