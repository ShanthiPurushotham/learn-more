# Proposal Submission Process

In the future Voi will be releasing a RFP to build a comprehensive Grants Portal for proposal submission and management. Until then we will be employing the following process. If you are interested in submitting a proposal for grant funding of any kind please review the procedure below: 

1. Thoroughly read the **Submitting Proposals** section of Voi's documentation along with this comprehensive [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rgZcpBtZY0rwq3W6-omnRjIGg54T8G3w1xjA_2usg84/edit) that contains additional details not included in this website. 
2.  Next, review the most up to date **Grants Calendar** to ensure you are aware of the relevant deadlines for the current funding round. The most up to date Grants Calendar can be found on the [Voi documentation website](https://docs.voi.network/) and Discord. Voi accepts proposals on a monthly basis for the first two weeks of each month, after which any submitted proposals get pushed for the next month's review. 
3. **Fill out the appropriate grant application** completely. Ensure that you provide thorough responses to each of the questions as incomplete applications are automatically rejected.

4. **Prepare the pitch deck and recorded pitch presentation** required for your appropriate grant as part of the application process and submit it with the above google form as a publicly viewable link. Microgrants do not require a pitch deck nor do Ecosystem Services Grants worth less than <$10,000 in Voi in requested funding.

5.  Any supporting documents if unable to be submitted via the application should be sent via email to the Council at [voi.grants@voi.network](mailto:voi.grants@voi.network) with identifying information in the email subject line to be able to associate it with the appropriate application (Name of project_Type of Grant_YYYMMDD). 
6. Prior to submission, we highly encourage you to review the **Grants Evaluation** section of the documentation so that you understand how your application will be evaluated.
