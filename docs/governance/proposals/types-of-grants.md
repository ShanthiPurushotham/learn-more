# Types of Grants

There are two main categories of grants availabe to the Voi community: **Development Grants** and **Ecosystem Services Grants**.  

**Development Grants**

Development grants go towards individual developers and development teams seeking to build an application or product on Voi. They are available to projects at various stages in the development process. For more information refer to this comprehensive [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rgZcpBtZY0rwq3W6-omnRjIGg54T8G3w1xjA_2usg84/edit).

There are three types of development grants: 1) Product Design Grants, 2) Build Grants, 3) Retroactive Grants, and 4) Micro Grants

 * **Product Design Grants**:Intended to validate ideas and concepts, helping developers prepare a detailed Product Blueprint for a successful build and launch on Voi.
 * **Build Grants**: Focused on the actual development and milestone-based funding of projects that have a completed Product Blueprint.
 * **Retroactive Grants**: Available for already completed and launched open-source projects or open-source features of otherwise closed-source projects on Voi with proven traction and track record of success.
 * **Micro Grants**: Microgrants are available for small scale development projects. They are dedicated to individuals eager to build out a project small in scope that may not require a full on product blueprint or significant development time.
   

**Ecosystem Services Grants**

Ecosystem Services grants are grants for community members and core partners, third party providers with an established partnership with Voi, that are seeking funding to support Voi in a wide spectrum of areas. This includes but is by no means limited to: marketing projects for Voi, writing articles for Voi’s blog, developing educational materials, contributing to Voi’s documentation, and supporting the development of governance tools.
