# Voi
**Built by You. Run by You. Owned by You.**

Welcome to Voi, a revolutionary L1 blockchain designed to fulfill the promises of Web3. Voi is a highly performant network truly owned, run, and built by its community. We believe in the power of decentralization, governance, and ownership, making blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all.

**Built by You:** Voi’s ecosystem is created by the community, leveraging the collective expertise and passion of its members. This ensures that Voi evolves to meet the real needs of its users, fostering innovation and adaptability from the ground up.

**Run by You:** Our democratic governance framework empowers the community to make key decisions. Voi’s Council, elected by token holders, guides the network’s direction and investments, ensuring that those who contribute to the ecosystem have a say in its future.

**Owned by You:** At Voi, 75% of the ecosystem's tokens are reserved for the community. This ensures that the people driving the ecosystem forward are the ones who benefit the most, promoting true ownership and shared success.

## Highly Performant
Voi Network boasts 2.8-second block times, instant finality, and the ability to handle 10K+ TPS under load. 

While these technical capabilities are impressive, we believe the true value of the network lies with the community. With you.

## Voi's Values
To ensure true decentralization, the Voi community adheres to these guiding values:

> - **Goodwill:** Assume positive intent, acting with kindness, compassion, and understanding.
> - **Integrity:** Maintain honesty and transparency in all communications and interactions within the ecosystem.
> - **Collaboration:** Prioritize collective efforts over individual pursuits, fostering innovation and accelerating Voi's vision.
> - **Intentionality:** Ensure thoughtful, purpose-driven actions and communications align with Voi’s broader mission.
