# Voi
**Built by You. Run by You. Owned by You.**

Welcome to Voi, a revolutionary L1 blockchain designed to fulfill the promises of Web3. Voi is a highly performant network truly owned, run, and built by its community. We believe in the power of decentralization, governance, and ownership, making blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all.

**Built by You:** Voi’s ecosystem is created by the community, leveraging the collective expertise and passion of its members. This ensures that Voi evolves to meet the real needs of its users, fostering innovation and adaptability from the ground up.

**Run by You:** Our democratic governance framework empowers the community to make key decisions. Voi’s Council, elected by token holders, guides the network’s direction and investments, ensuring that those who contribute to the ecosystem have a say in its future.

**Owned by You:** At Voi, 75% of the ecosystem's tokens are reserved for the community. This ensures that the people driving the ecosystem forward are the ones who benefit the most, promoting true ownership and shared success.

## What is Voi?
Voi is more than just a blockchain; it's a multichain ecosystem that places the community and ecosystem at its core. Unlike other projects, Voi reserves 75% of its market cap for earned incentives, distributed over 20 years. This model ensures that the builders, users, and evangelists are the true owners, not just early investors.

Voi utilizes existing free technology, adapting and improving it to best serve the ecosystem. Our governance system, inspired by democratic countries, empowers all token holders to have a say, ensuring the ecosystem is led by those who are actively involved. 

Voi is a beacon for how blockchain should operate, where the technology is a tool, and the ecosystem is the focus.

## A Refocus on the True Value of Blockchain
The real value of blockchain technology lies in its potential to empower communities and align incentives with ecosystem health and growth. As the industry evolves, there's a shift towards community-driven models over traditional distribution models. 

Voi leads this change by focusing on genuine community engagement and long-term success.

### Opportunity
Blockchain, predominantly open-source, often sees initial investments as sunk costs, with non-contributing token holders representing bad debt. Communities can easily relaunch blockchains, ensuring better distribution and sustainability. This trend underscores the importance of tokens reflecting true value, aligning incentives with ecosystem health.

Crypto enthusiasts increasingly favor distribution models that prioritize community involvement over insiders. This shift towards open, inclusive processes over exclusive connections marks a significant industry evolution. 

Voi is at the forefront, building a strong, inclusive community.

## Defensibility
"Pioneers get the arrows; settlers get the land." New blockchain technologies often see significant investments in developing open-source software, which become sunk costs upon release. Voi addresses this by ensuring tokens are in the hands of value-adding community members, who are incentivized to stay engaged.

Voi's model decouples token value from the technology, allowing the ecosystem to adopt new innovations seamlessly. This flexibility is a significant advantage, enabling Voi to integrate the latest and most effective technologies while maintaining a strong, active community focused on genuine contribution.

## Why Choose Voi? Long-term Value for Supporters

### True Community Ownership
Voi allocates 75% of its total token supply to the community, ensuring that the majority of tokens are held by active contributors. This model fosters real ownership and meritocracy, distributing tokens based on actual contributions, and ensuring those driving the network's success are the primary beneficiaries.

### Decentralized and Democratic Governance
Voi’s governance framework features a tripartite system: a community-elected legislative council, an executive branch managing the treasury, and a judicial branch for oversight. This structure ensures transparent, accountable, and decentralized decision-making, preventing undue control by any single entity. Community members play a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem's future.

### Sustainable and Inclusive Ecosystem
By emphasizing fair token distribution and community governance, Voi fosters a sustainable and inclusive environment. The network's design encourages continuous participation and long-term engagement, making it a stable and thriving ecosystem for all stakeholders. This approach not only ensures fairness but also fosters innovation and adaptability.

## Crypto Native Market
Voi addresses critical issues faced by the crypto-native community, such as disenfranchisement, lack of ownership, and insufficient recognition of contributions. By ensuring true ownership, value recognition, and community governance, Voi offers an ecosystem where contributors are rewarded and represented fairly. The governance framework places decision-making power in the hands of the community, promoting a truly decentralized and inclusive environment.

### True Ownership and Value Recognition
Voi ensures that contributors, including developers, validators, and community members, are appropriately rewarded. The ecosystem's tokenomics prioritize earned incentives, allowing participants to benefit from their contributions, unlike platforms where insiders disproportionately gain. 

This model aligns value distribution with community efforts.

### Empowering the Community
Voi's governance framework involves community members in key decision-making processes, ensuring the ecosystem evolves according to collective interests. This structure includes checks and balances to prevent any single entity from dominating, promoting a decentralized and inclusive environment.

## Highly Performant
Voi Network boasts 2.8-second block times, instant finality, and the ability to handle 10K+ TPS under load. 

While these technical capabilities are impressive, we believe the true value of the network lies with the community. With you.

## Voi's Values

> - **Goodwill:** Assume positive intent, acting with kindness, compassion, and understanding.
> - **Integrity:** Maintain honesty and transparency in all communications and interactions within the ecosystem.
