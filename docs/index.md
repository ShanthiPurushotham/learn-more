## Voi Chain

Voi is a community-owned and operated L1 blockchain and ecosystem. 

Voi uniquely allocates a majority of the ecosystemâ€™s resources to those directly adding value to the network. Voi aims mto solve the problem found in many blockchains today, which is a lack of decentralization, lack of self governance, lack of community investment, and continued complexity that inhibits mainstream usage.
