## A refocus on the true value of blockchain

## Opportunity:
Blockchain technology, being predominantly open-source, renders initial investments as sunk costs and tokens held by non-contributing individuals as bad debt. Consequently, blockchains not primarily owned by active, value-adding participants will likely be relaunched by their communities. This process is simplified in the blockchain world, where a cohesive and strong community can easily spin up a new chain, ensuring better distribution and sustainability. This approach creates a significant opportunity for tokens to represent the true value of the ecosystem, effectively using the technology as a means to an end and aligns incentives with ecosystem health and growth.

A noticeable trend is emerging in the crypto space: crypto natives are becoming more discerning about distribution models, favoring those that emphasize community involvement over traditional VC funding. This will lead VCs to act more like hedge funds, trading tokens post-launch or taking smaller allocations, the focus is shifting towards building strong, inclusive communities, not the largest raise. This shift suggests a growing recognition that true traction and authentic metrics are best achieved through open, community-driven processes rather than exclusive pitches and insider connections. 

We are at the forefront of this trend, positioning ourselves for long-term success.

## What is Voi:
Voi is not just another blockchain; it is a multichain ecosystem that abstracts away the networks and focuses effort on where the true value lies. The community and the ecosystem. Voi ensures that the owners of the ecosystem are the builders, users, and evangelists, rather than just early investors and stakeholders. Seventy-five percent of the entire market cap is reserved for earned incentives, with emissions spread over the next 20 years.

Voi doesn't build new technology from the ground up. Instead, we leverage the incredible free technology that already exists, adopting new advancements or improving existing ones based on what best serves the ecosystem. The treasury is managed by a novel community run governance system modeled after the USA, efficiently placing control in the hands of all token holders, not just a select few while allowing innovators to lead the way. Voi exemplifies how blockchain has always been destined to operate, where the technology serves as a means to an end, and the ecosystem is the star of the show where value is focused.

## Traction:
Since June 2024, Voi has demonstrated significant growth and engagement, reflecting its strong ecosystem and community support:

* **Community Growth:** Twitter followers surged from 3,000 in May 2024 to 30,000+. Discord members increased from 2,750 to 23,000+ in the same period, with Telegram users growing from 300 to 8,000+.
* **Active Participation:** The number of online voting nodes grew from 850 to 4,000+.
* **Real People:** Kibisis wallet installations saw a significant rise, from 900 to 16,500+. This reflects a robust user base of people, not bots. Some multibillion L1s have around 30K installs.
* **NFT Games During Testnet:** Over 30 NFT projects completed, highlighting active developer and collection engagement and innovation.
* **Launched Projects:** More than 25 projects have been launched on Voi, including DEXes, wallets, launchpads, marketplaces, bridges, block explorers, payment rails, node tooling, indexers, and Discord bots, all built by community members.
* **Committees:** Over 300 individuals have signed up and are actively participating and engaged in community committees, playing a crucial role in the governance of Voi.

## Defensibility:

Pioneers get the arrows, Settlers get the land. While new blockchain technologies will continue to emerge, their funding often goes into developing free and open-source software and infrastructure. This significant investment, funded by a large portion of the market cap, ultimately becomes a sunk cost once the technology is developed and released as open source. The majority of the tokens need to be in the hands of value-adding members of the ecosystem. Otherwise, the newcomers face three choices: pay off the debt, siphon value from the network and move on, or restart the chain to remove the debt if they believe in the technology.

Voi shortcuts this inevitable process. By valuing the ecosystem and distributing tokens based on earned incentives, Voi ensures that tokens are in the hands of individuals who are actively adding value, providing them with a strong incentive to remain engaged. Additionally, by decoupling the value of the token from the technology, Voi can adopt new innovations as they emerge and add them to the ecosystem rather than being bound to a singular technology. This adaptability gives Voi a significant advantage, as it brings along an entire ecosystem incentivized to utilize the latest and most effective technology.

By putting ownership in the hands of value adders, Voi stops the cycle. These individuals have skin in the game and a vested interest in the ecosystem's success, giving them the incentive to stay and contribute rather than leaving or starting over. This ensures a sustainable and thriving ecosystem, continuously driven by those who add real value.
